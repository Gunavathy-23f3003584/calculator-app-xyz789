## Project Description

This project involved updating an existing calculator application to expand its capabilities. The core objective was to integrate new mathematical operations—specifically square root and percentage—alongside the standard arithmetic functions. Additionally, a crucial user experience enhancement was the inclusion of a clear button to easily reset the calculator's state and display.

## Features

The calculator provides the following functionalities:

*   **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Square Root (`√`)**: Calculate the square root of the currently displayed number.
*   **Percentage (`%`)**: Compute percentages (e.g., for discounts or tax calculations).
*   **Clear (`C`) Button**: Reset the calculator's display and internal state instantly.
*   **Decimal Support**: Handle calculations involving decimal numbers.
*   **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be accessible and usable across various devices and screen sizes.
